# Release Notes Draft

## Status
- Release not cut in this update.

## Rationale
- No prior tags or release cadence detected; adding a full release requires
  maintainers to confirm versioning and distribution expectations.
- This change set focuses on download reliability improvements and
  documentation/automation updates.

## Suggested Next Step
- Confirm target version and packaging requirements, then generate a tagged
  release with updated assets and changelog entries.
